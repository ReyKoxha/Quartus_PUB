## About
Quartus is a very simple and plain CS:GO cheat coded in VB.NET.
The majority of this code is C+P, uncommented and unoptimized.
Therefore, I do not advise trying to use it for your "kul P2C HvH chets".

Talking about HvH. This cheat is far away from competing with any P2C hacks.
As long as you won't expect too much, it will be fine though.

## Requirements
Compiling requires Visual Studio and is targeted for .NET 4.7.1.

## F.A.Q.
#### Q.: How do I use the HWID lock?
#### A.: Simply create a MSSQL Database (Azure). The table should contain usernames, password (hashed as MD5) and the HWID. Alternatively you can just delete the Login.vb and let the program start from the Main.vb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Q.: How do I open up the menu?
#### A.: Alt + Up (Arrow key)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Q.: How do I reload?
#### A.: Usually everything will adjust live. In case it doesn't, simply hit F5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Q.: THIS CHET DESENT WORK!
#### A.: Thats not a question.
